# HELMET DETECTION
This model detects the helmet of workers whether they are wearing helmets or not in a particular , may be a dangerous workspace where helmets are neccessary.It uses the implementation of Deep Learning , Keras and OpenCV for the training of the  model.Note that this model only runs on GPU

## PRE-REQUISITES 

For Windows

- Anaconda Navigator

- OpenCV 

- Tensorflow(Keras included)





### STEPS FOR CREATING THE MODEL
The whole process for helmet detection using Keras can be divided in following  major steps:

a. Upload the dataset(from Kaggle). Click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/hard-hat-detection "HD") to see it. The dataset consists of 5000 images and also contains the xml file with two classes: one having helmet and other not having helmet.

b. Detect helmet in an image using Keras and OpenCV

c. Convert image into grayscale(given in RGB form) 

d. Design convolutional neural network using Keras

e. Train the model on the test model on testing data after doing Image Augmentation
